        <p>
            Mattel, Inc. is an American multinational toy manufacturing company founded in 1945 with headquarters in El Segundo, California. Harold "Matt" Matson and Elliot Handler founded Mattel in 1945. The company sold picture frames, and later dollhouse furniture. Matson sold[when?] his share to Handler due to poor health, and Handler's wife Ruth took Matson's role. In 1947, the company had its first hit toy, a ukulele called "Uke-A-Doodle".
             In the early 1980s, Mattel produced video game systems, under its own brands and under license from Nintendo. The company has presence in 40 countries and territories and sells products in more than 150 countries.[3] The company operates through three business segments: North America, international, and American Girl.
